# B-plus-Tree

Description:

This repository offers a well-structured and efficient implementation of the B+ tree data structure in Java. Designed for clarity and ease of use, it provides essential operations for key-value storage and retrieval, making it suitable for various applications requiring fast data access and organization.

Key Features:

# Memory-Resident or Disk-Based Usage: Choose between in-memory storage for efficiency or persistent storage on disk for durability.
# Optimized Insertion and Search: Leverage B+ tree's inherent advantages for efficient key insertion and retrieval, even with large datasets.
# Range Queries: Perform efficient range queries to retrieve keys within a specific range.
# Duplicate Key Handling: Optionally support duplicate keys by storing associated values as lists or using custom key-value pair classes.
# Customizable Order: Adapt the tree's branching factor (order) to balance performance and memory usage as needed.
# Clear Unit Tests: Ensure code correctness and reliability through comprehensive unit tests.
